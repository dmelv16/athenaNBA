Getting Data in Batches

This following information only applies to the /teams, /events, and /odds endpoints.

Most endpoints will always return all results which match your query. However, since the /teams, /events, and /odds endpoints can potentially return hundreds or even thousands of results, the resulting objects are paginated/limited and must be fetched in batches.

The number of items by each request to these endpoints is determined by the limit parameter. This parameter currently has a default value of 10 but can be overridden up to a max value of 100.

In some cases you may want to fetch all of the results from these endpoints. To do this, you can feed the nextCursor in the resonse as the cursor parameter in your next request to pick up where you left off. When the response does not contain a nextCursor property, you have reached the end of the results.

Let’s take the following example, where we want to grab all finalized NBA events:
Javascript
Python
Ruby
PHP
java

import requests

next_cursor = None
event_data = []

while True:
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://api.sportsgameodds.com/v2/events', params={
            'leagueID': 'NBA',
            'marketOddsAvailable': True,
            'limit': 50,
            'cursor': next_cursor
        })

        data = response.json()
        event_data.extend(data['events'])

        next_cursor = data.get('nextCursor')
        if not next_cursor:
            break

    except Exception as error:
        print(f'Error fetching events: {error}')
        break

for event in event_data:
    odds = event['odds']
    for odd_id, odd_object in odds.items():
        print(f'Odd ID: {odd_id}')
        print(f'Odd Value: {odd_object["closeOdds"]}')
		
Rate Limiting

Based on the package you chose, your API key will be limited to a certain number of requests made and/or objects returned during a given time interval. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a 429 status code and will be unable to make further requests until the limit resets.

While we do make changes to our standard rate limits, these changes usually won’t affect existing subscribers, so unless you receive an email, your rate limit will remain the same as it was when you signed up. Therefore, the limits posted in this guide may be different from those your API key is subject to.
Request Limits

Each request you make to the Sports Game Odds API server will count towards your request rate limit.

    Amateur plan: 10 requests per minute
    Rookie plan: 60 requests per minute
    Pro plan: 1,000 requests per minute

Object Limits

Each request you make to the Sports Game Odds API server may return multiple objects in the response. Each object returned will count towards your object rate limit over a given time interval. Each response counts as a minimum of 1 object.

    Amateur plan: 1,000 objects per month
    Rookie plan: 5M objects per month
    Pro plan: Unlimited objects per month

Default Limits

In order to protect our servers and ensure maximum uptime, the following default limits apply to all API keys. In general you shouldn’t ever hit these limits regardless of your plan, but if you do, feel free to reach out to us and we can find a solution for removing or increasing these default limits

    50k requests per hour
    300k objects per hour
    7M objects per day

Strategies to Avoid Rate Limiting

To protect your application from rate limiting, you can use the following strategies:

    Avoid a high frequency of calls to endpoints serving data that doesn’t change frequently (e.g., Teams, Players, Stats).
    Cache this data locally to avoid making unnecessary requests.
    Make use of available query params at each endpoint to focus on only the data you need.
    You can always fetch data about your current rate limit usage using the /account/usage endpoint.

Response Filtering Notice

When your API key has limitations that cause data to be filtered from responses (such as limited bookmakers or restricted data types), you may receive a notice field in the API response. This notice informs you about what data has been filtered and can be accessed at higher API tiers.

The notice field appears in responses when:

    Events are filtered due to sport or league restrictions
    Bookmaker odds are filtered due to bookmaker access limitations
    Data types are filtered due to subscription tier restrictions

Example response with notice:

{
    "success": true,
    "data": [...],
    "nextCursor": "n.1720564800000.DCtqsAt8d0GIFAvMmfzD",
    "notice": "Response is missing 3 events and 15 bookmaker odds. Upgrade your API key to access all data from this query."
}

This notice is designed to help you understand when your current subscription might be limiting your access to data, allowing you to make informed decisions about upgrading your plan.

I have the amateur plan for now.
